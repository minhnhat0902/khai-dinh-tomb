# History

## Background

King *Khải Định*, whose real name was *Nguyễn Phúc Bửu Đảo*, was born in 1986
and died in 1925. He was the 12th king of the *Nguyễn* Dynasty, ruling Vietnam
under French colonialism. He was notorious for being a gambler, a flamboyant
dresser and a puppet for the French. He spent huge sums on magnificent
construction projects such as *An Định* Palace, *Kiến Trung* Palace and his
tomb. These projects along with his 1922 trip to France and grandiose 40th
birthday further aroused public anger at the king&rsquo;s character.

## Construction

Immediately after his coronation in 1916, King *Khải Định* chose *Châu Chữ*
Mountain, lying 8 kilometers south of *Huế* Citadel as his resting place. On
September 4th, 1920, the mausoleum began construction under the command of the
Commander-in-Chief *Lê Văn Bá*. Later, King *Khải Định* renamed the mountain to
Mount *Ứng*, so the mausoleum was named *Ứng* tomb. In 1925, King *Khải Định*
passed away at the age of 40 and was buried in the unfinished mausoleum. His
son, King *Bảo Đại*, took over the tomb&rsquo;s construction. It was not until 1931
that *Khải Định* mausoleum was completed.

## Location&rsquo;s Significance

The mausoleum&rsquo;s location is carefully chosen to ensure harmony with feng shui
principles. *Châu Chữ* Mountain, where the mausoleum leans against, acts as the
head rest. A low hill to the mausoleum&rsquo;s front acts as a screen. *Châu Ê* stream
flows from left to right, forming the element of converging water. *Chóp Vung*
Mountain and Mount *Kim* flank the mausoleum&rsquo;s two sides, forming the elements
of &ldquo;blue dragon on the left&rdquo; and &ldquo;white tiger on the
right.&rdquo;

# Architecture

## Overview

*Khải Định* Tomb was built along the mountainside, divided into 5 floors. Along
the tomb&rsquo;s 127 steps are dragon statues facing downwards. Although it is the
smallest tomb among the *Nguyễn* Dynasty tombs, *Khải Định* Tomb took the
longest to build because of its elaborate and eclectic architecture. The tomb
has a blend of traditional Vietnamese, Indian, Buddhist and Western styles. Some
materials such as iron, steel, cement and slates were imported from France,
while ceramics and colored glass were purchased from China and Japan.
Craftsmen from all over Vietnam were summoned for the tomb&rsquo;s construction.

## *Tam Quan* Gate

The first flight of steps lead to the mausoleum&rsquo;s main entrace&mdash;the Tam
Quan Gate. The pointed gate pillars show influence from Indian architecture.

## Mandarin&rsquo;s Houses

Located on the left and right sides of the first floor are two shrines
dedicated to honorable mandarins. The roofs are designed in a double-layered
rectangular shape traditional to Vietnam. However, unlike other traditional
temples, the rafters of the two Mandarin&rsquo;s Houses are made of cement.

## *Nghi Môn* Gate

In front of the Honor Court on the second floor is *Nghi Môn* Gate. *Nghi Môn*
Gate employs the three-gateway structure similar to temples and palaces in
Vietnamese traditional style; most notably, a similar gate with the same name
can be seen in *Huế* Citadel. Nghi Môn Gate&rsquo;s pillars resemble the
&ldquo;dragons and clouds encircling pillars&rdquo; of *Huế* Citadel, but the
use of cement and the thicker shape are evident of European influence.
Embellished above the middle gateway are two cement dragons facing a ball of
fire.

## Rows of Statues

On both sides of the second floor are two rows of life-size statues of civil
and military mandarins and soldiers facing the middle of the yard. In
addition, a pair of horse statues and a pair of elephant statues are also
placed symmetrically on both sides. The stone army served to gaurd the king&rsquo;s
journey to the afterlife.

## Stele Pavillion

At the back of the second floor is the Stele Pavilion. The cement pavillion
has two levels of ocatagonal roof covered with slate tiles. The design for
columns and arches took inspiration from European architecture. Inside the
pavillion is a 3.1-meter high stone stele etched with King *Khải Định*&rsquo;s son&rsquo;s,
namely King *Bảo Đại*&rsquo;s, words about his father&rsquo;s achievements. The stele is
intricately carved, similar to other traditional stone steles in Huế.

## *Trụ Biểu*

The two *Trụ Biểu*s are tall pillars on either side of the Stele Pavillion. The
*Trụ Biểu*s host spires similar to those of Buddhist stupas.

## *Thiên Định* Palace

On the top floor is *Thiên Định* Palace&mdash;the main structure of the
mausoleum. *Thiên Định* Palace consists of three main rooms and two side rooms.

## *Khải Thành* Palace

This is the front room of *Thiên Định* Palace, where the altar of King Khải Định
is located.

## Burial Chamber

The burial chamber is located behind *Khải Thành* Palace. The chamber&rsquo;s
centerpiece is one-to-one scale bronze statue of King *Khải Định* cast in France
in 1920. Arriving to Vietnam, the statue was plated with a layer of gold by
*Huế* craftsmen. Above the statue is a canopy cast from cement weighing almost
one ton. The canopy is decorated with porcelain inlay. King *Khải Định* was 8
meters below the bronze statue. The room behind the burial chamber is where the
king&rsquo;s tablet for worshipping placed. This area is currently off-limits to
visitors.

## &ldquo;Nine Dragons amidst Fleeting Clouds&rdquo;

On the ceiling of each of the three main rooms of *Thiên Định* Palace is a
&ldquo;Nine Dragons amidst Fleeting Clouds&rdquo; painting. Artist *Phan Văn Tánh*
painted them with his feet to observe his overall process due to the paintings&rsquo;
inconvenient placement. Because dragons are a symbol for the king, *Phan Văn Tánh*&rsquo;s
technique was considered blasphemous. According to local legend, during a survey
of the tomb construction project, King *Khải Định* told *Phan Văn Tánh*: &ldquo;
If Vietnam has two *Phan Văn Tánh*s like you, I would have cut your head off.
&rdquo;

## Porcelain Art

The walls and altars of *Thiên Định* Palace are covered with paintings, reliefs
and verses inlaid with porcelain and glass. The porcelain and glass pieces were
taken from bottles and bowls from East Asian countries. These colorful works
depict images of animals, plants, dragons, clouds, etc., based on the stories of
the Vietnamese Three Religions (Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism) and folklore.
The reliefs also depict images of tea trays, crowns, as well as modern items
such as alarm clocks, tennis rackets, and oil lamps.

# Impact and Value

## Impact

*Khải Định* Tomb is one of many examples of King *Khải Định*&rsquo;s extravagant
taste. To pay for the tomb&rsquo;s construction, King *Khải Định* raised land taxes
nationwide by 30%. For that reason, the project further worsened the king&rsquo;s
reputation for both the people then and historians now.

## Cultural Value

*Khải Định* Tomb&rsquo;s electic architectural style received mixed opinions.
Contemporaries thought it was an unorthodox and ostentatious
amalgamation. However, many current historians consider the work to be an
architectural masterpiece that reflects the diversity in style and ideology of
King *Khải Định*. As a result, in 1993, Khai Dinh Tomb, along with many other
works in the Hue Imperial Citadel Complex, was recognized by UNESCO as a World
Cultural Heritage.
